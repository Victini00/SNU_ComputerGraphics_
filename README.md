## ðŸŽ® Assignment #1 â€” Hierarchical Modeling

**Objective:**  
Design a 3-level hierarchical model using primitive transformations (translation, rotation, scaling), and animate it to show its structure.

**Highlights:**
- Constructed a hierarchical articulated model (e.g., robot arm).
- Used multiple primitive shapes (cubes, cylinders) and transformation matrices.
- Animated joints independently to demonstrate the hierarchy.
- Code written in Pyglet using custom transformation logic.

## ðŸ§± Assignment #2 â€” Cornell Box Scene Modeling

**Objective:**  
Recreate a real-world Cornell Box using geometric primitives and match its physical layout and camera setup in a 3D scene.

**Highlights:**
- Built a box with red, green, and white walls and placed boxes and spheres inside.
- Manually measured dimensions and camera FOV to align virtual and real views.
- Enabled interactive camera via a trackball viewer.
- Includes photo references and matching render screenshots.

## ðŸŽ¢ Assignment #3 â€” Roller Coaster Simulation

**Objective:**  
Simulate a moving cart along a smooth spline-based roller coaster track using physically-based motion.

**Highlights:**
- Constructed a closed B-spline loop for the track.
- Implemented arc-length reparameterization to ensure constant-speed motion.
- Defined a Frenet frame (Tangent-Normal-Binormal) moving smoothly along the spline.
- Added realistic motion: speed varies based on track height via energy conservation.
- First-person camera mode implemented to ride the coaster.

## ðŸªž Assignment #4 â€” Shading and Texture Mapping

**Objective:**  
Reproduce a photorealistic render of the Cornell Box scene using custom shaders, BRDF simulation, and texture mapping techniques.

**Highlights:**
- Apply Phong shading to Cornell Box.
- Select appropriate BRDF parameters and textures for Materials.
- Insert a surface light source approximated by a point light source.

## ðŸ”¦ Assignment #5 â€” Ray Tracing

**Objective:**  
Render the Cornell Box scene from Assignment #2 with photorealistic quality using ray tracing. OpenGL and Pyglet are no longer used; instead, image data is directly generated by casting rays per pixel and simulating light transport physically.

**Highlights:**
- Implemented primary ray casting through each pixel to compute color based on geometry, lighting, and material.
- Simulated **shadow rays** to determine occlusion and produce realistic soft shadows using an **area light source**.
- Added **recursive reflection and refraction** to support glossy and transparent materials such as glass spheres or mirrors.
- Included optional features like **supersampling**, **depth of field**, and **motion blur** to improve visual realism.
- Accelerated rendering using **BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy)**, drastically reducing rendering time for complex scenes.
- Compared rendered results against:
  - A **real-world photograph** of the Cornell box
  - The **Pyglet render with shading/texture mapping** (Assignment #4)
- Final output stored and displayed using the **Pillow** image library.
