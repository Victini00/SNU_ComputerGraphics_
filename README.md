## ðŸŽ® Assignment #1 â€” Hierarchical Modeling

**Objective:**  
Design a 3-level hierarchical model using primitive transformations (translation, rotation, scaling), and animate it to show its structure.

**Highlights:**
- Constructed a hierarchical articulated model (e.g., robot arm).
- Used multiple primitive shapes (cubes, cylinders) and transformation matrices.
- Animated joints independently to demonstrate the hierarchy.
- Code written in Pyglet using custom transformation logic.

## ðŸ§± Assignment #2 â€” Cornell Box Scene Modeling

**Objective:**  
Recreate a real-world Cornell Box using geometric primitives and match its physical layout and camera setup in a 3D scene.

**Highlights:**
- Built a box with red, green, and white walls and placed boxes and spheres inside.
- Manually measured dimensions and camera FOV to align virtual and real views.
- Enabled interactive camera via a trackball viewer.
- Includes photo references and matching render screenshots.

## ðŸŽ¢ Assignment #3 â€” Roller Coaster Simulation

**Objective:**  
Simulate a moving cart along a smooth spline-based roller coaster track using physically-based motion.

**Highlights:**
- Constructed a closed B-spline loop for the track.
- Implemented arc-length reparameterization to ensure constant-speed motion.
- Defined a Frenet frame (Tangent-Normal-Binormal) moving smoothly along the spline.
- Added realistic motion: speed varies based on track height via energy conservation.
- First-person camera mode implemented to ride the coaster.

## ðŸªž Assignment #4 â€” Shading and Texture Mapping

**Objective:**  
Reproduce a photorealistic render of the Cornell Box scene using custom shaders, BRDF simulation, and texture mapping techniques.

**Highlights:**
- Apply Phong shading to Cornell Box.
- Select appropriate BRDF parameters and textures for Materials.
- Insert a surface light source approximated by a point light source.
